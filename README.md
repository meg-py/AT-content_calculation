# AT-content_calculation
_A simple code to calculate AT-content of any user-given DNA sequence._
**Significance of AT-content of DNA sequence**: 
  DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is often referred to as the 'blueprint' of life. It is mainly composed of a 5-carbon pentose sugar (called as deoxyribose), phosphate molecules and 4 types of Nitrogenous bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G). These bases form specific pairs with each other, with A pairing exclusively with T, and C exclusively with G, facilitating the cohesion of the two strands of DNA.
  Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) are crucially formed during base pairing, with two hydrogen bonds stabilizing the A-T pair and three hydrogen bonds stabilizing the G-C pair.
  Generally,  higher AT content in DNA sequences generally suggests lower thermodynamic stability compared to lower AT content. This is because AT base pairs form fewer hydrogen bonds (two) compared to GC base pairs (three). Consequently, DNA sequences with higher AT content are more prone to denaturation and less stable under conditions such as high temperature or chemical stress.
**Indication:** 
  However, the context of AT content and its biological significance may vary based on several factors like type of organism or species, presence of regulatory regions and others.
